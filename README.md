# Loan-prediction

This project predicts loan approval based on applicant data. The dataset, stored in the data/ directory, contains information crucial for loan approval assessment. Employing Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, and Matplotlib, the loan_prediction.ipynb Jupyter notebook explores the dataset, preprocesses it, trains multiple models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest), and evaluates their performance using metrics like accuracy and F1-score. To use, clone the repository, install dependencies listed in requirements.txt, and execute the notebook to gain insights into model training, selection, and application for loan approval predictions.
